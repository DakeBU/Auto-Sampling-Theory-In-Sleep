## Compact Task Contract

# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
discharges-supplied-hypothesis reviewer acceptance: accepted SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCanonicalBarBWeakConditionalFpNamedLawDerivativeOfEmIntervalMeasIntDominated; discharged hsampleInt from SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCanonicalBarBWeakConditionalFpNamedLawDerivativeOfEmIntervalMeasDominated using named-law Measure.map integrability transport plus Mathlib Integrable.comp_aemeasurable/integrable_map_measure. Remaining hsampleDerivMeas hsampleDerivBound hboundInt hpathDeriv hderivValue and canonical source-action identities. Gate python3 tools/astis.py check passed; proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0; no wrapper churn, broad audit, non-EM fallback, SLT import, Lake/toolchain change, theorem-status promotion, fake closure, or sald_version_2.

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.

## Cycle Focus

Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: discharges-supplied-hypothesis reviewer acceptance: accepted SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCanonicalBarBWeakConditionalFpNamedLawDerivativeOfEmIntervalMeasIntDominated; discharged hsampleInt from SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCanonicalBarBWeakConditionalFpNamedLawDerivativeOfEmIntervalMeasDominated using named-law Measure.map integrability transport plus Mathlib Integrable.comp_aemeasurable/integrable_map_measure. Remaining hsampleDerivMeas hsampleDerivBound hboundInt hpathDeriv hderivValue and canonical source-action identities. Gate python3 tools/astis.py check passed; proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0; no wrapper churn, broad audit, non-EM fallback, SLT import, Lake/toolchain change, theorem-status promotion, fake closure, or sald_version_2.. For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.
