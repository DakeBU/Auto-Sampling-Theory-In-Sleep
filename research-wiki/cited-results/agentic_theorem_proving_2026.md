## Reviewer rules

- Do not ask lower agents to rederive a standard analytic cut in several
  theorems; make it a named technical lemma or a cited-result obligation.
- A source-cited analytic theorem may guide proof planning but does not close a
  Lean target until ported locally or imported as an audited dependency.
- Exploratory theorem generation is allowed for RMFLD-style active research,
  not for mutating faithful SALD theorem statements.
