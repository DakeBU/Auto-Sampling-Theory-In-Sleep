# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-152 lower_2 dynamic-leaf worker packet in the weak-FP source-field illness area: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteWeakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacianOfPointwise narrows hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian to the smaller pointwise source boundary hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian over appendix.tex:1379-1387. Earlier cycle-152 bridge narrows hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqSourceField to hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef plus hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef; lower_1 narrows hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef to hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian plus SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteSourceTestLaplacianEqStdIteratedFDeriv. Remaining direct leaves: hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef, htraceFieldEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, state-event and sibling EM leaves. Consulted local SALD declarations, conversion/proof-obligation records, original appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1368-13...

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-154 lower_2: SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegralOfTraceStateIntegralLaplacianField narrows hemGeneratorTraceLawIntegral to hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral plus htraceFieldMeas, hhatRhoS, hhatX, keeping htraceFieldEqLaplacian and sibling EM/weak-FP leaves explicit. Gate passed: python3 tools/astis.py check.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary dynamic-leaf upper handoff after mandatory gate pass; next lower packet narrows hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral to hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral plus htraceFieldEqLaplacian via suggested SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorTraceStateIntegralOfLaplacianStateIntegralLaplacianField; no SLT import or wrapper churn.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary dynamic-leaf middle handoff: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorTraceStateIntegralOfLaplacianStateIntegralLaplacianField narrowing hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral to hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral plus htraceFieldEqLaplacian; synchronized conversion/proof-obligation/SLT/Lean dependency records; gate passed python3 tools/astis.py check.
- lower_1 scout handoff: narrows hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral to hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral plus htraceFieldEqLaplacian via SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorTraceStateIntegralOfLaplacianStateIntegralLaplacianField; gate passed python3 tools/astis.py check; role stored as lower because astis.py rejects lower_1 for trial-log.
- lower_2 narrows-source-cited-boundary verification: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorTraceStateIntegralOfLaplacianStateIntegralLaplacianField narrows hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral to hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral plus htraceFieldEqLaplacian; duplicate wrapper rejected; gate passed python3 tools/astis.py check.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-155 dynamic-leaf worker packet: SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorTraceStateIntegralOfLaplacianStateIntegralLaplacianField narrows hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral to hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral plus htraceFieldEqLaplacian; remaining EM/weak-FP leaves explicit; no fake closure, wrapper churn, non-EM fallback, SLT import, theorem-status promotion, Lake/toolchain change, or sald_version_2 use. Gate passed: python3...

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Blueprint Control State

- Stage: LeanMarathon Stage-2 analogue: DAG-guided proof discharge after faithful source transcript stabilization
- Latest cycle: 155
- Dynamic leaf candidate: narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-152 lower_2 dynamic-leaf worker packet in the weak-FP source-field illness area: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteWeakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacianOfPointwise narrows hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian to the smaller pointwise source boundary hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian over appendix.tex:1379-1387. Earlier cycle-152 bridge narrows hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqSourceField to hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef plus hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef; lower_1 narrows hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef to hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian plus SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteSourceTestLaplacianEqStdIteratedFDeriv. Remaining direct leaves: hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef, htraceFieldEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, state-event and sibling EM leaves. Consulted local SALD declarations, conversion/proof-obligation records, original appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1368-13...
- Illness area candidate: lower_1 narrows-source-cited-boundary dynamic-leaf proof-scout handoff. Compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegralOfTraceLawIntegralLaplacianField narrows the cycle-154 state-integral trace-field route by replacing hemGeneratorTraceActionDef+htraceFieldStdBasis with hemGeneratorTraceLawIntegral+htraceFieldEqLaplacian; hsourceLaplacianFunctional, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hhatRhoS, hhatX, event-field, weak-FP pointwise source-field, state-event, and sibling EM leaves remain explicit. Gate passed: python3 tools/astis.py check. Next lower_2 theorem/proof block: attack hemGeneratorTraceLawIntegral, with the expected route through hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral plus hhatRhoS/hhatX/htraceFieldMeas and SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorTraceLawIntegralOfStateIntegral.
- Task blueprint: `research-wiki/blueprints/ASTIS-SALD-001.md`.
- Borrowed LeanMarathon controls: blueprint system-of-record, target review, dynamic leaves, illness-area refiner, deterministic gate.
- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Maintain conversion windows, proof obligations, source indexes, SLT reuse audit, and lower packets. Use the compact context pack instead of rereading broad historical task text. Treat the LeanMarathon-style blueprint state as the system-of-record summary: translate only the chosen dynamic leaf or illness area into lower-ready declarations, and keep unrelated DAG regions out of scope. For SALD after cycle 69, read the TeX around the active EM conditional-law/Fokker--Planck focus and translate only that backend into lower-ready Lean declarations; avoid fresh theorem-route audits unless needed for source correctness. For SALD after cycle 84, classify every lower packet as either `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`, `narrows-source-cited-boundary`, or `rejected-wrapper-churn`; lower-ready declarations should name the exact Mathlib/local theorem boundary and source line. Before inventing an abstraction, inspect the local `lean-stat-learning-theory` reference for Mathlib measure/probability idioms that can be ported locally under this project's toolchain. Also follow the MathCode-inspired theorem-reuse discipline: search existing ASTIS declarations, conversion windows, proof obligations, and cited-result ledgers before creating a duplicate interface. Before lower work, translate the relevant LaTeX proof step into Lean-facing declarations; after lower/reviewer work, translate accepted Lean declarations and remaining obligations back into Markdown/LaTeX notes. External lookup discipline: upper and middle may use network search when local context is insufficient for Mathlib names, Lean API examples, or standard SDE/measure-theory statements such as weak Fokker-Planck, Green identities, trace theorems, or divergence theorems. Prefer primary sources: Mathlib docs/source, Lean project repositories, arXiv papers, or official project documentation. Any external result must be converted into a local ASTIS compiled declaration or a precise source-cited ProofObligation; do not mark it formalized just because it was found online. During this sprint, avoid broad rebaseline work, broad SLT/SDE library import, and lower packets outside the active EM backend unless reviewer found a blocker. Export the Overleaf-ready project article only at the end of a multi-hour batch. For SALD cycle 130 and later, treat the cycle-129 illness-area boundary as the live target unless the reviewer records a newer one: `hdiffusionSource` has been narrowed to the EM/Brownian diffusion generator weak action plus weak Laplacian integration-by-parts action. Do not reassign already-discharged leaves `hsampleInt`, `hsampleDerivMeas`, `hsampleDerivBound`, `hboundInt`, `hpathDeriv`, `hderivValue`, `hdriftBarBAction`, raw `hpairMeas`, or `hcanonicalBarBMeas`. For SALD cycle 151 and later, the reviewer-accepted cycle-150 boundary overrides older broad guards. The active EM conditional-law / weak-FP backend remains `sald.general_moving_target_discrete.em_interpolation_fp` over `appendix.tex:1358-1387`, with source anchors `appendix.tex:984-995`, `appendix.tex:1368-1387`, and `appendix.tex:1379-1387`. Prioritize one direct definition/equality leaf at a time: `htraceFieldEqLaplacian`, `hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqTraceField`, `hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral`, or `hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas`. Upper should choose the smallest leaf that reduces this boundary; middle should coordinate the proof route and split lower-agent roles; lower_1 should produce the natural-language/math route and lower_2 should implement exactly one compiled Lean theorem or a strictly smaller source-cited obligation. Reject new total-event/source-functional consumer wrappers unless they discharge one of these direct leaves. Reviewer must check that the remaining boundary is strictly smaller, not merely renamed, and that `python3 tools/astis.py check` passes.
