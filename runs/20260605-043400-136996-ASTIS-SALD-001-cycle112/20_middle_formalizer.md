# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
Remaining exact boundary: source density-ratio a.e. equality with hat rho_...

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.
```

Cycle focus:

```text
Post-84 closure 4: discharge one supplied EM hypothesis: Choose exactly one supplied hypothesis used by cycles 80-84 and replace it with a compiled local theorem or a narrower source-cited boundary.  The acceptable targets are conditional-kernel existence, conditional integral regularity, generator-to-law weak FP, or log-ratio admissibility.

# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.

## Cycle Focus

Post-84 closure 4: discharge one supplied EM hypothesis: Choose exactly one supplied hypothesis used by cycles 80-84 and replace it with a compiled local theorem or a narrower source-cited boundary.  The acceptable targets are conditional-kernel existence, conditional integral regularity, generator-to-law weak FP, or log-ratio admissibility.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- discharges-supplied-hypothesis: compiled dominated parametric-integral generator-to-law handoff for appendix.tex:1379-1387, discharging hsampleGenerator; mandatory gate passed.
- discharges-supplied-hypothesis. Reviewer accepted cycle 110 after mandatory gate passed and proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0. The dominated generator-to-law theorem removes hsampleGenerator via Mathlib parametric-integral plus existing lawMapIntegral transport, with no source drift, SLT import, Lake change, fake closure, theorem-status promotion, wrapper churn, or non-active work. Remaining boundary is concrete EM pointwise derivative/domination, derivative-value identification, hbarBCondExp, no-boundary, and...
- narrows-source-cited-boundary: selected the appendix.tex:1358-1366 KL target-time derivative/integrability subtheorem inside SALD.GeneralMovingTargetDiscretePureRawKlDerivativeNoMassAtFiniteKlLlr; rejects hkl/hlog/hmass/weak-FP wrapper churn; mandatory astis check passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary; compiled target-time dominated parametric-integral handoff for appendix.tex:1358-1366; gate passed; forbidden_hits=0
- narrows-source-cited-boundary: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteTargetTimeDerivativeSourceRatioCongr for appendix.tex:1358-1366; source-ratio a.e. congruence bridge for target-time integral/integrability/HasDerivAt after dominated theorem; mandatory astis check passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary. Reviewer accepted cycle 111 after mandatory gate passed and proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0. The compiled target-time packet narrows ASTIS.SALD.cycle105.remaining_pure_raw_kl_boundary for appendix.tex:1358-1366: SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteTargetTimeDerivativeOfDominated proves the weighted target-density derivative/integrability subterm by Mathlib parametric integral, SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteTargetTimeDerivativeSourceRatioCongr isolates the source density-ratio a.e....

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (exists): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (exists): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Maintain conversion windows, proof obligations, source indexes, SLT reuse audit, and lower packets. Use the compact context pack instead of rereading broad historical task text. For SALD after cycle 69, read the TeX around the active EM conditional-law/Fokker--Planck focus and translate only that backend into lower-ready Lean declarations; avoid fresh theorem-route audits unless needed for source correctness. For SALD after cycle 84, classify every lower packet as either `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`, `narrows-source-cited-boundary`, or `rejected-wrapper-churn`; lower-ready declarations should name the exact Mathlib/local theorem boundary and source line. Before inventing an abstraction, inspect the local `lean-stat-learning-theory` reference for Mathlib measure/probability idioms that can be ported locally under this project's toolchain. Also follow the MathCode-inspired theorem-reuse discipline: search existing ASTIS declarations, conversion windows, proof obligations, and cited-result ledgers before creating a duplicate interface. Before lower work, translate the relevant LaTeX proof step into Lean-facing declarations; after lower/reviewer work, translate accepted Lean declarations and remaining obligations back into Markdown/LaTeX notes. During this sprint, avoid broad rebaseline work, broad SLT/SDE library import, and lower packets outside the active EM backend unless reviewer found a blocker. Export the Overleaf-ready project article only at the end of a multi-hour batch.
