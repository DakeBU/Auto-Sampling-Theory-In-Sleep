# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
Remaining boundary is the internal-paper scalar Brownian/Ito coordinate decomposition and per-coordinate Hessian generator theorem from eq:general_moving_target_SALD_frozen_interp and appendix.tex:1379-1387

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.
```

Cycle focus:

```text
Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: Remaining boundary is the internal-paper scalar Brownian/Ito coordinate decomposition and per-coordinate Hessian generator theorem from eq:general_moving_target_SALD_frozen_interp and appendix.tex:1379-1387. For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: Remaining boundary is the internal-paper scalar Brownian/Ito coordinate decomposition and per-coordinate Hessian generator theorem from eq:general_moving_target_SALD_frozen_interp and appendix.tex:1379-1387.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Cycle-159 lower_2 compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldBrownianPointwiseDefOfStdBasis, narrowing hEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldBrownianPointwiseDef to hEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldBrownianPointwiseStdBasisDef over appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1379-1387. Remaining source boundary is hEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldBrownianPointwiseStdBasisDef. Gate passed: python3 tools/astis.py check.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary upper illness-area refiner packet after mandatory gate pass; target remains sald.general_moving_target_discrete.em_interpolation_fp over appendix.tex:1358-1387; exact remaining boundary hEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldBrownianPointwiseStdBasisDef should be narrowed to a named source-cited frozen scalar Brownian/Ito generator coordinate-trace interface, with weak-FP source-field/trace-field/downstream consumer wrappers rejected.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary middle packet: compiled SALD.emFrozenScalarBrownianItoGeneratorEventField and SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldBrownianPointwiseStdBasisDefOfFrozenScalarBrownianItoGenerator, narrowing hEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldBrownianPointwiseStdBasisDef to hFrozenScalarBrownianItoGeneratorEventFieldDef over appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1379-1387; conversion/proof-obligation notes updated; gate passed python3 tools/astis.py check.
- lower_1 recorded as lower because astis.py rejects lower_1. narrows-source-cited-boundary proof-scout packet. Compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldFrozenScalarBrownianItoGeneratorDefOfPointwise, narrowing hFrozenScalarBrownianItoGeneratorEventFieldDef to hFrozenScalarBrownianItoGeneratorEventFieldPointwiseDef. Remaining lower_2-ready theorem: pointwise scalar Brownian/Ito generator equality from eq:general_moving_target_SALD_frozen_interp and appendix.tex:1379-1387, with sigma_e...
- lower_2 recorded as lower because astis.py rejects lower_2. narrows-source-cited-boundary lower_2 packet: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldFrozenScalarBrownianItoPointwiseDefOfCoordinateGenerator, narrowing hFrozenScalarBrownianItoGeneratorEventFieldPointwiseDef to hFrozenScalarBrownianItoEventFieldCoordinateSum plus hFrozenScalarBrownianItoCoordinateGeneratorDef; conversion/proof-obligation/SLT audit notes updated; no SLT import; gate passed python3 tools/astis.py check.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-160 lower_2 coordinate-generator narrowing: hFrozenScalarBrownianItoGeneratorEventFieldPointwiseDef follows from hFrozenScalarBrownianItoEventFieldCoordinateSum plus hFrozenScalarBrownianItoCoordinateGeneratorDef through compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldFrozenScalarBrownianItoPointwiseDefOfCoordinateGenerator.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Blueprint Control State

- Stage: LeanMarathon Stage-2 analogue: DAG-guided proof discharge after faithful source transcript stabilization
- Latest cycle: 160
- Dynamic leaf candidate: Remaining boundary is the internal-paper scalar Brownian/Ito coordinate decomposition and per-coordinate Hessian generator theorem from eq:general_moving_target_SALD_frozen_interp and appendix.tex:1379-1387
- Illness area candidate: Remaining boundary is the internal-paper scalar Brownian/Ito coordinate decomposition and per-coordinate Hessian generator theorem from eq:general_moving_target_SALD_frozen_interp and appendix.tex:1379-1387
- Task blueprint: `research-wiki/blueprints/ASTIS-SALD-001.md`.
- Borrowed LeanMarathon controls: blueprint system-of-record, target review, dynamic leaves, illness-area refiner, deterministic gate.
- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Audit build gate, fake proof closures, source correspondence, cited results, and SLT port status. Also audit efficiency: reject a successful-looking cycle if it consumed the prompt on broad context replay, wrapper churn, or a non-active target while the compact context pack names a narrower blocker. Apply LeanMarathon-style target-review discipline: no more/no less than the source theorem, deterministic gate is the only progress authority, and a worker packet may not escape its local region without a concrete issue. Reject contract drift, missing source anchors, or any claim marked proved without a compiled Lean declaration. Use the MathCode-inspired diagnostics policy: hidden `axiom`, `constant`, `postulate`, `sorry`, `admit`, `Prop := True`, or `:= trivial` closures are blocking defects, and proof statistics should be used to notice suspicious broad rewrites. Also check backend-focus discipline: reject cycles that only add rebaseline/ledger work, broad route audits, unrelated display algebra, or SLT import claims when the active EM conditional-law/Fokker--Planck backend could have been advanced. For SALD cycle 151 and later, the reviewer-accepted cycle-150 boundary overrides older broad guards. The active EM conditional-law / weak-FP backend remains `sald.general_moving_target_discrete.em_interpolation_fp` over `appendix.tex:1358-1387`, with source anchors `appendix.tex:984-995`, `appendix.tex:1368-1387`, and `appendix.tex:1379-1387`. Prioritize one direct definition/equality leaf at a time: `htraceFieldEqLaplacian`, `hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqTraceField`, `hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral`, or `hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas`. Upper should choose the smallest leaf that reduces this boundary; middle should coordinate the proof route and split lower-agent roles; lower_1 should produce the natural-language/math route and lower_2 should implement exactly one compiled Lean theorem or a strictly smaller source-cited obligation. Reject new total-event/source-functional consumer wrappers unless they discharge one of these direct leaves. Reviewer must check that the remaining boundary is strictly smaller, not merely renamed, and that `python3 tools/astis.py check` passes.
