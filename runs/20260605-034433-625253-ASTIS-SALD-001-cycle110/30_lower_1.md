Task contract:

```text
# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
narrows-source-cited-boundary. Reviewer accepted cycle 109: mandatory gate passed, proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0, and SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpSourceDef compiles as a source-definition bridge for appendix.tex:1368-1377 without direct hbarBAe wrapper or dependency drift. Remaining blocker is ASTIS.SALD.cycle109.remaining_condExp_source_representative_for_named_barB: prove the selected sample-space conditional-expectation representative for barB and equality-set measurability for ae_map_iff; keep next packet compact.

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.
```

Cycle focus:

```text
Post-84 closure 2: generator-to-law weak-FP boundary: Target `appendix.tex:1379-1387`: turn sample-path derivative plus `Measure.map`/Bochner integral transport into the weak generator-to-law Fokker--Planck statement.  Use existing cycle-79 `lawMapIntegral` helpers and Mathlib parametric-integral APIs; do not create another wrapper unless it removes a supplied hypothesis.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- narrows-source-cited-boundary: compiled product-flux Frechet derivative handoff for hatRhoS*barB; remaining box-trace blocker is divergence integrability plus boundaryFlux/interior-divergence and signed-face/testTrace identifications; gate passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary. Reviewer accepted cycle 108 after mandatory gate passed and proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0. The cycle narrowed the active hatRhoS*barB box-trace instantiation by compiling product-flux continuity and off-countable Frechet derivative handoffs at appendix.tex:1379-1387 with barB from appendix.tex:1368-1377. No fake closure, sald_version_2 use, SLT import, Lake dependency change, theorem-status promotion, broad route audit, non-EM fallback, or wrapper churn found. Remaining blocke...
- narrows-source-cited-boundary: selected appendix.tex:1368-1377 named barB a.e. source-definition theorem, ASTIS.SALD.cycle106.remaining_named_barB_version_boundary, for sald.general_moving_target_discrete.em_interpolation_fp; gate passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary. Compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpKernelSourceDef and recorded remaining ASTIS.SALD.cycle109.remaining_condExpKernel_source_def_and_kernel_alignment; mandatory gate passed.

Reviewer accepted cycle 109: mandatory gate passed, proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0, and SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpSourceDef compiles as a source-definition bridge for appendix.tex:1368-1377 without direct hbarBAe wrapper or dependency drift.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (exists): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (exists): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Attempt one narrow proof-producing Lean task for the assigned active backend before creating more ledger-only obligations. Do not change the theorem target. Begin by naming the packet classification and the exact supplied hypothesis or missing theorem boundary. Do not work on unrelated display algebra, route audits, or general API cleanup unless the upper/middle packet explicitly assigns it. After cycle 84, a new supplied-hypothesis wrapper is acceptable only if it removes an older supplied hypothesis, exposes a strictly smaller missing theorem boundary, or produces a compiled local theorem using Mathlib/local SLT-style ingredients. Do not add fake proof closures; if the analysis fact is not formalized, add a precise source-cited interface or refine a ProofObligation and keep the build green. In Phase 1 faithfulPaper mode, do not introduce broad library reorganizations or educational APIs unless upper/middle explicitly assign them.
