Task contract:

```text
# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
Remaining exact boundary: prove hlaplacianEqEmGenerator, hemGeneratorSourceActionDef, hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, htestLaplacianStdBasisDef, density-Laplacian source facts, Green/trace/box-divergence leaves, and diffusion leaves.

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.
```

Cycle focus:

```text
Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: Remaining exact boundary: prove hlaplacianEqEmGenerator, hemGeneratorSourceActionDef, hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, htestLaplacianStdBasisDef, density-Laplacian source facts, Green/trace/box-divergence leaves, and diffusion leaves.. For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Blueprint Control State

- Stage: LeanMarathon Stage-2 analogue: DAG-guided proof discharge after faithful source transcript stabilization
- Latest cycle: 141
- Dynamic leaf candidate: Remaining exact boundary: prove hlaplacianEqEmGenerator, hemGeneratorSourceActionDef, hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, htestLaplacianStdBasisDef, density-Laplacian source facts, Green/trace/box-divergence leaves, and diffusion leaves.
- Illness area candidate: narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Dynamic-leaf worker packet inside the cycle-141 EM generator trace-field illness area. Accepted exact narrowing: hemGeneratorTraceActionDef is replaced by hemGeneratorTraceLawIntegral plus hsourceLaplacianFunctional through SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteWeakFpSourceActionDefOfEmGeneratorTraceLawIntegralSourceFormula, with upstream hemGeneratorSourceActionDef -> hemGeneratorStdBasisDef and hemGeneratorStdBasisDef -> hemGeneratorTraceActionDef plus htraceFieldStdBasis still source-cited and explicit. Source anchors appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1379-1387 checked; local Mathlib Laplacian bridge reused; no SLT import/consultation. Gate python3 tools/astis.py check passed; proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0; no wrapper churn, non-EM fallback, broad audit, theorem-status promotion, sald_version_2 use, Lake/toolchain change, or fake closure.
- Task blueprint: `research-wiki/blueprints/ASTIS-SALD-001.md`.
- Borrowed LeanMarathon controls: blueprint system-of-record, target review, dynamic leaves, illness-area refiner, deterministic gate.
- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Choose one faithful-paper objective, mode discipline, non-goals, lower packet, and reviewer checklist. First read the compact context pack and run the self-reflection guard: if the planned packet is wrapper churn, reject it and choose a narrower target. Use the LeanMarathon-inspired proof blueprint: choose either the current dynamic leaf candidate for worker-style proof discharge, or a named illness-area refiner packet when the blocker affects a connected sub-DAG. Begin with a concise `Global phase judgment:` paragraph that answers: did the previous cycle fail and need recovery; is Phase 1 theorem-skeleton translation stable enough for cited-theory backfill; and which single lower packet now reduces the largest proof risk. For SALD after cycle 69, treat the theorem-skeleton route as stable enough for single-backend backfill. Keep the source theorem fixed and now prioritize the active EM conditional-law/Fokker--Planck backend over new transcript/ledger expansion, broad theorem-route audits, or isolated scalar sublemmas. For SALD after cycle 84, do not let the run accumulate more supplied-hypothesis wrappers unless they discharge or strictly narrow an existing supplied hypothesis. The priority is a smallest real backend theorem boundary: conditional kernel/conditional expectation, generator-to-law weak FP, KL/log-ratio admissibility, or one named LSI/DV/Gronwall blocker. If recent trial memory shows a failed cycle after an upper or middle handoff, recover that cycle first instead of advancing to a new source target. Before assigning middle/lower work, explicitly check that the active lower packet still targets `sald.general_moving_target_discrete.em_interpolation_fp` over `appendix.tex:1358-1387`, unless reviewer identified a theorem-route blocker. Do not spend the cycle on source-index rebaseline unless reviewer found a blocking source-anchor defect. Faithful work has two phases: Phase 1 is a complete source-to-Lean transcript with exact constants and obligations; Phase 2, only after the transcript is complete, reorganizes reusable APIs for teaching, later SDE/Sampling papers, and exploratoryProof mode. Require middle to keep two-way Lean/Markdown/LaTeX synchronization, but defer polished project-article export to the batch end. If a cited analytic theorem is too large to prove now, require a precise source-cited interface and keep its status below formalized. External lookup discipline: upper and middle may use network search when local context is insufficient for Mathlib names, Lean API examples, or standard SDE/measure-theory statements such as weak Fokker-Planck, Green identities, trace theorems, or divergence theorems. Prefer primary sources: Mathlib docs/source, Lean project repositories, arXiv papers, or official project documentation. Any external result must be converted into a local ASTIS compiled declaration or a precise source-cited ProofObligation; do not mark it formalized just because it was found online. Use `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory` as a reference for Mathlib measure/probability style when helpful, but do not import it as a Lake dependency or claim an SLT theorem is formalized unless a local ASTIS declaration compiles. For SALD cycle 130 and later, treat the cycle-129 illness-area boundary as the live target unless the reviewer records a newer one: `hdiffusionSource` has been narrowed to the EM/Brownian diffusion generator weak action plus weak Laplacian integration-by-parts action. Do not reassign already-discharged leaves `hsampleInt`, `hsampleDerivMeas`, `hsampleDerivBound`, `hboundInt`, `hpathDeriv`, `hderivValue`, `hdriftBarBAction`, raw `hpairMeas`, or `hcanonicalBarBMeas`.
