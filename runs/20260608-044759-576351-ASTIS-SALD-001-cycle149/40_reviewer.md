# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-148 lower_2 dynamic-leaf packet narrowing hemGeneratorLaplacianTotalEventIntegral to hemGeneratorSourceActionDef plus hsourceLaplacianFunctional plus existing hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqLaplacian through compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianTotalEventIntegralOfSourceFunctional. Gate passed: python3 tools/astis.py check. Remaining boundaries: hemGeneratorSourceActionDef, hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqLaplacian, htraceFieldEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianStateEventEqLaplacian when not supplied by pointwise rewrite, and sibling EM/weak-FP leaves. No SLT import or port claim, sald_version_2 use, non-EM fallback, wrapper churn, theorem-status/Lake/toolchain change, broad audit, or fake closure.

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.

Cycle focus:

```text
Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-148 lower_2 dynamic-leaf packet narrowing hemGeneratorLaplacianTotalEventIntegral to hemGeneratorSourceActionDef plus hsourceLaplacianFunctional plus existing hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqLaplacian through compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianTotalEventIntegralOfSourceFunctional.

Remaining boundaries: hemGeneratorSourceActionDef, hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqLaplacian, htraceFieldEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianStateEventEqLaplacian when not supplied by pointwise rewrite, and sibling EM/weak-FP leaves. No SLT import or port claim, sald_version_2 use, non-EM fallback, wrapper churn, theorem-status/Lake/toolchain change, broad audit, or fake closure.. For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

- Task blueprint: `research-wiki/blueprints/ASTIS-SALD-001.md`.
- Borrowed LeanMarathon controls: blueprint system-of-record, target review, dynamic leaves, illness-area refiner, deterministic gate.
- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Audit build gate, fake proof closures, source correspondence, cited results, and SLT port status. Also audit efficiency: reject a successful-looking cycle if it consumed the prompt on broad context replay, wrapper churn, or a non-active target while the compact context pack names a narrower blocker. Apply LeanMarathon-style target-review discipline: no more/no less than the source theorem, deterministic gate is the only progress authority, and a worker packet may not escape its local region without a concrete issue. Reject contract drift, missing source anchors, or any claim marked proved without a compiled Lean declaration. Use the MathCode-inspired diagnostics policy: hidden `axiom`, `constant`, `postulate`, `sorry`, `admit`, `Prop := True`, or `:= trivial` closures are blocking defects, and proof statistics should be used to notice suspicious broad rewrites. Also check backend-focus discipline: reject cycles that only add rebaseline/ledger work, broad route audits, unrelated display algebra, or SLT import claims when the active EM conditional-law/Fokker--Planck backend could have been advanced.
