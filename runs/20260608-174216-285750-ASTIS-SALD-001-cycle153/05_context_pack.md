## Compact Task Contract

# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-152 lower_2 dynamic-leaf worker packet in the weak-FP source-field illness area: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteWeakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacianOfPointwise narrows hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian to the smaller pointwise source boundary hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian over appendix.tex:1379-1387. Earlier cycle-152 bridge narrows hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqSourceField to hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef plus hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef; lower_1 narrows hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef to hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian plus SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteSourceTestLaplacianEqStdIteratedFDeriv. Remaining direct leaves: hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef, htraceFieldEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, state-event and sibling EM leaves. Consulted local SALD declarations, conversion/proof-obligation records, original appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1368-13...

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.

## Cycle Focus

Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-152 lower_2 dynamic-leaf worker packet in the weak-FP source-field illness area: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteWeakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacianOfPointwise narrows hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian to the smaller pointwise source boundary hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian over appendix.tex:1379-1387. Earlier cycle-152 bridge narrows hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqSourceField to hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef plus hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef; lower_1 narrows hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef to hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian plus SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteSourceTestLaplacianEqStdIteratedFDeriv. Remaining direct leaves: hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef, htraceFieldEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, state-event and sibling EM leaves. Consulted local SALD declarations, conversion/proof-obligation records, original appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1368-13.... For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-151 dynamic-leaf lower_2 packet: SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqLaplacianOfWeakFpSourceField narrows hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqLaplacian to hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqSourceField plus hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian; earlier cycle-151 bridge narrows hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqTraceField to hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqLaplacian plus htraceFieldEqLaplacian.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.
