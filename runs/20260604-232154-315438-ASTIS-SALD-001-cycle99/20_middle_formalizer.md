Task: ASTIS-SALD-001 - Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs
Cycle: 99
Role: middle
Run directory: runs/20260604-232154-315438-ASTIS-SALD-001-cycle99

Task contract:

```text
# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
Remaining exact boundary is the concrete contraction bound plus weakGradPairing/driftDiv definition alignment and no-boundary IBP for hatRhoS * barB.

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.
```

Cycle focus:

```text
Post-84 closure 3: KL/log-ratio analytic boundary: Target `appendix.tex:1358-1366`: formalize or precisely isolate KL differentiability at the admissible log-ratio weak test, including log-ratio measurability/integrability and the handoff from weak-FP action to `dK`.  Keep theorem statements unchanged.
```

# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

## Cycle Focus

Post-84 closure 3: KL/log-ratio analytic boundary: Target `appendix.tex:1358-1366`: formalize or precisely isolate KL differentiability at the admissible log-ratio weak test, including log-ratio measurability/integrability and the handoff from weak-FP action to `dK`.  Keep theorem statements unchanged.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- Cycle 97 lower narrows-source-cited-boundary via SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribComponentWeakPairingOfIntegralAction; raw hcanonical is reduced to paired-integrand integrability plus componentAction and weakGradPairing canonical definition alignment, with hfieldAe and hweakAeCongr explicit. Remaining blockers: condC/condScore definition/integrability facts and hatRhoS*barB divergence/no-boundary. source-index and astis check passed.
- Cycle 97 reviewer accepted gate=pass: source-index, proof-diagnostics, and astis check passed. Classified middle discharges-supplied-hypothesis for condDistrib map-law disintegration; lower narrows-source-cited-boundary via SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribComponentWeakPairingOfIntegralAction. No fake closure, contract drift, status promotion, source/sign/constant change, SLT import, Lake dependency change, or sald_version_2 source drift found. Remaining blockers are paired-integrand integrability, com...
- Cycle 98 upper queued Post-84 closure 2 on appendix.tex:1379-1387 generator-to-law weak-FP boundary; selected lower packet targets barB component pairing definition/integrability or exact divergence/no-boundary blocker, rejecting wrapper churn.
- Cycle 98 middle narrows-source-cited-boundary: removed raw hbarBWeakDivergence from the barB drift-source route under explicit law-integral/no-boundary hypotheses; updated Lean DAG/dependencies and ledgers; source-index and astis check passed.
- Cycle 98 lower discharges-supplied-hypothesis: compiled barB bounded-pairing integrability handoff removing hpairIntegrable from the no-boundary drift-source route under Integrable barB hatRhoS plus measurable a.e. norm-bound hypotheses; remaining blockers are contraction bound, weakGradPairing/driftDiv definition alignment, and no-boundary IBP for hatRhoS*barB. source-index and astis check passed.
- Cycle 98 reviewer accepted gate=pass: source-index, proof-diagnostics, and astis check passed. Accepted middle as narrows-source-cited-boundary for the barB law-integral/no-boundary split and lower as discharges-supplied-hypothesis for hpairIntegrable via the bounded-pairing integrability theorem. No fake closure, contract drift, theorem-status promotion, sign/coefficient/source drift, SLT import, Lake dependency change, or sald_version_2 use found.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (exists): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (exists): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Maintain conversion windows, proof obligations, source indexes, SLT reuse audit, and lower packets. Use the compact context pack instead of rereading broad historical task text. For SALD after cycle 69, read the TeX around the active EM conditional-law/Fokker--Planck focus and translate only that backend into lower-ready Lean declarations; avoid fresh theorem-route audits unless needed for source correctness. For SALD after cycle 84, classify every lower packet as either `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`, `narrows-source-cited-boundary`, or `rejected-wrapper-churn`; lower-ready declarations should name the exact Mathlib/local theorem boundary and source line. Before inventing an abstraction, inspect the local `lean-stat-learning-theory` reference for Mathlib measure/probability idioms that can be ported locally under this project's toolchain. Also follow the MathCode-inspired theorem-reuse discipline: search existing ASTIS declarations, conversion windows, proof obligations, and cited-result ledgers before creating a duplicate interface. Before lower work, translate the relevant LaTeX proof step into Lean-facing declarations; after lower/reviewer work, translate accepted Lean declarations and remaining obligations back into Markdown/LaTeX notes. During this sprint, avoid broad rebaseline work, broad SLT/SDE library import, and lower packets outside the active EM backend unless reviewer found a blocker. Export the Overleaf-ready project article only at the end of a multi-hour batch.
