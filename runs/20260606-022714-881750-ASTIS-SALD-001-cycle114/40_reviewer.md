Task: ASTIS-SALD-001 - Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs
Cycle: 114
Role: reviewer
Run directory: runs/20260606-022714-881750-ASTIS-SALD-001-cycle114

Mandatory gate:

Task contract:

```text
# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.
```

Cycle focus:

```text
Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied. For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

## Cycle Focus

Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied. For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- narrows-source-cited-boundary: compiled state-event set-integral bridge for appendix.tex:1368-1377 hbarBCondExp boundary; gate passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary. Reviewer accepted cycle 112 after mandatory gate passed; proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0. hbarBCondExp in SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpSourceDef is replaced by compiled conditional-expectation uniqueness and state-event set-integral handoffs. Remaining exact boundary is candidate regularity plus the source state-event set-integral characterization for selected barB(hatXAtS omega).
- narrows-source-cited-boundary. Pressure test of thm:forward-KL-discrete reaches the compiled EM/target-time/scalar LSI-DV-Gronwall route; next non-wrapper blocker is ASTIS.SALD.cycle112.remaining_named_barB_set_integral_characterization for appendix.tex:1368-1377, consumed by SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateSetIntegralDef. Lower packet is candidate regularity plus source state-event Bochner set-integral characterization for barB(hatXAtS omega). Mandatory astis check passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary: cycle113 pressure test routes thm:forward-KL-discrete through compiled EM wrappers plus LSI/DV/Gronwall; first non-wrapper blocker is ASTIS.SALD.cycle112.remaining_named_barB_set_integral_characterization consumed by SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateSetIntegralDef at appendix.tex:1368-1377. Updated conversion/proof-obligation/SLT audit docs; gate passed.
- discharges-supplied-hypothesis: cycle 113 lower compiled named barB state-field regularity pullback and downstream state-field set-integral bridge; hbarBMeas/hbarBInt discharged, remaining blocker is source state-event Bochner set-integral characterization; mandatory ASTIS check passed.
- discharges-supplied-hypothesis. Reviewer accepted cycle 113 after python3 tools/astis.py check passed and proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0. hbarBMeas/hbarBInt in SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateSetIntegralDef are discharged by compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteNamedBarBComapRegularityOfStateField and SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateFieldSetIntegralDef.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Blueprint Control State

- Stage: LeanMarathon Stage-2 analogue: DAG-guided proof discharge after faithful source transcript stabilization
- Latest cycle: 113
- Dynamic leaf candidate: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied
- Illness area candidate: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied
- Task blueprint: `research-wiki/blueprints/ASTIS-SALD-001.md`.
- Borrowed LeanMarathon controls: blueprint system-of-record, target review, dynamic leaves, illness-area refiner, deterministic gate.
- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Audit build gate, fake proof closures, source correspondence, cited results, and SLT port status. Also audit efficiency: reject a successful-looking cycle if it consumed the prompt on broad context replay, wrapper churn, or a non-active target while the compact context pack names a narrower blocker. Apply LeanMarathon-style target-review discipline: no more/no less than the source theorem, deterministic gate is the only progress authority, and a worker packet may not escape its local region without a concrete issue. Reject contract drift, missing source anchors, or any claim marked proved without a compiled Lean declaration. Use the MathCode-inspired diagnostics policy: hidden `axiom`, `constant`, `postulate`, `sorry`, `admit`, `Prop := True`, or `:= trivial` closures are blocking defects, and proof statistics should be used to notice suspicious broad rewrites. Also check backend-focus discipline: reject cycles that only add rebaseline/ledger work, broad route audits, unrelated display algebra, or SLT import claims when the active EM conditional-law/Fokker--Planck backend could have been advanced.
