Task: ASTIS-SALD-001 - Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs
Cycle: 114
Role: lower
Run directory: runs/20260606-022714-881750-ASTIS-SALD-001-cycle114

Mandatory gate:

Task contract:

```text
# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.
```

Cycle focus:

```text
Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied. For the current SALD state this means stay on the EM conditional-drift/state-event set-integral boundary unless reviewer records a named Mathlib/theory gap; do not take a non-EM fallback merely because the old cycle schedule rotates there.

Blueprint-guided dynamic leaf: use `python3 tools/astis.py blueprint-refresh ASTIS-SALD-001` and target the refreshed dynamic leaf / illness area rather than the old rotating focus. Current blocker: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied.

## Recent High-Signal Handoffs

- narrows-source-cited-boundary: compiled state-event set-integral bridge for appendix.tex:1368-1377 hbarBCondExp boundary; gate passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary. Reviewer accepted cycle 112 after mandatory gate passed; proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0. hbarBCondExp in SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpSourceDef is replaced by compiled conditional-expectation uniqueness and state-event set-integral handoffs. Remaining exact boundary is candidate regularity plus the source state-event set-integral characterization for selected barB(hatXAtS omega).
- narrows-source-cited-boundary. Pressure test of thm:forward-KL-discrete reaches the compiled EM/target-time/scalar LSI-DV-Gronwall route; next non-wrapper blocker is ASTIS.SALD.cycle112.remaining_named_barB_set_integral_characterization for appendix.tex:1368-1377, consumed by SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateSetIntegralDef. Lower packet is candidate regularity plus source state-event Bochner set-integral characterization for barB(hatXAtS omega). Mandatory astis check passed.
- narrows-source-cited-boundary: cycle113 pressure test routes thm:forward-KL-discrete through compiled EM wrappers plus LSI/DV/Gronwall; first non-wrapper blocker is ASTIS.SALD.cycle112.remaining_named_barB_set_integral_characterization consumed by SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateSetIntegralDef at appendix.tex:1368-1377. Updated conversion/proof-obligation/SLT audit docs; gate passed.
- discharges-supplied-hypothesis: cycle 113 lower compiled named barB state-field regularity pullback and downstream state-field set-integral bridge; hbarBMeas/hbarBInt discharged, remaining blocker is source state-event Bochner set-integral characterization; mandatory ASTIS check passed.
- discharges-supplied-hypothesis. Reviewer accepted cycle 113 after python3 tools/astis.py check passed and proof-diagnostics forbidden_hits=0. hbarBMeas/hbarBInt in SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateSetIntegralDef are discharged by compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteNamedBarBComapRegularityOfStateField and SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteCondDistribNamedBarBAeEqOfCondExpStateFieldSetIntegralDef.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

## Blueprint Control State

- Latest cycle: 113
- Dynamic leaf candidate: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied
- Illness area candidate: Remaining exact blocker: ASTIS.SALD.cycle113.remaining_named_barB_state_event_set_integral / hbarBStateSetIntegral for appendix.tex:1368-1377, plus Integrable barB hatRhoS if not source-supplied
- Task blueprint: `research-wiki/blueprints/ASTIS-SALD-001.md`.
- Borrowed LeanMarathon controls: blueprint system-of-record, target review, dynamic leaves, illness-area refiner, deterministic gate.
- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Attempt one narrow proof-producing Lean task for the assigned active backend before creating more ledger-only obligations. Do not change the theorem target. Begin by naming the packet classification and the exact supplied hypothesis or missing theorem boundary. If this is a worker-style packet, stay inside the assigned local target/refinement region before asking for upstream changes; if it is a refiner-style packet, edit only the connected illness area named by middle. Do not work on unrelated display algebra, route audits, or general API cleanup unless the upper/middle packet explicitly assigns it. After cycle 84, a new supplied-hypothesis wrapper is acceptable only if it removes an older supplied hypothesis, exposes a strictly smaller missing theorem boundary, or produces a compiled local theorem using Mathlib/local SLT-style ingredients. Do not add fake proof closures; if the analysis fact is not formalized, add a precise source-cited interface or refine a ProofObligation and keep the build green. In Phase 1 faithfulPaper mode, do not introduce broad library reorganizations or educational APIs unless upper/middle explicitly assign them.
