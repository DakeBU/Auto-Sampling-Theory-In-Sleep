# Faithfully reproduce the original VA-SALD paper proofs

Status: active faithfulPaper reproduction of the original VA-SALD paper.
Source: `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/sald/paper`; exclude `sald_version_2.tex`.
Current phase: Phase 1 faithful transcript and proof backfill; Phase 2 API reorganization is deferred.

Current post-cycle-84 rule: do not add broad wrappers or broad theorem-route audits. Each cycle must either discharge one supplied hypothesis, strictly narrow one source-cited theorem boundary, or explicitly reject wrapper churn.

Active blocker:
narrows-source-cited-boundary reviewer acceptance after mandatory gate. Accepted cycle-152 lower_2 dynamic-leaf worker packet in the weak-FP source-field illness area: compiled SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteWeakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacianOfPointwise narrows hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian to the smaller pointwise source boundary hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian over appendix.tex:1379-1387. Earlier cycle-152 bridge narrows hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqSourceField to hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef plus hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef; lower_1 narrows hweakFpSourceFieldStdBasisDef to hweakFpSourceFieldEqLaplacian plus SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteSourceTestLaplacianEqStdIteratedFDeriv. Remaining direct leaves: hweakFpSourceFieldPointwiseEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldStdBasisDef, htraceFieldEqLaplacian, hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral, hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas, hsourceLaplacianFunctional, state-event and sibling EM leaves. Consulted local SALD declarations, conversion/proof-obligation records, original appendix.tex:984-995 and appendix.tex:1368-13...

Allowed packet classifications:
- `discharges-supplied-hypothesis`: compiled local theorem removes an older supplied hypothesis.
- `narrows-source-cited-boundary`: exact missing theorem is smaller and source-cited with imports/hypotheses.
- `rejected-wrapper-churn`: proposed work only restates a supplied hypothesis or broad ledger.

## Local SLT And Paper Reuse

- SLT local project (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/lean-stat-learning-theory`.
- SLT paper source (missing): `/home/nitanda_sub/mark/repos/RMFLD/Statistical Learning Theory in Lean 4 Empirical Processes from Scratch`.
- First consult `SLT/EfronStein.lean` for conditional expectation/product-measure proof engineering.
- Consult `SLT/GaussianLSI/TensorizedGLSI.lean`, `SLT/GaussianMeasure.lean`, and `SLT/SmallBallProb.lean` for `Measure.map`, integral, product, and Bochner-style rewrites.
- Consult the SLT article LaTeX for the writing principle: expose measurable/topological hypotheses explicitly; do not promote background analysis until a local ASTIS declaration compiles.
- Do not add SLT as a Lake dependency while the toolchain mismatch remains; port local statements or record cited proof obligations.

Gate passed: python3 tools/astis.py check. Next lower_2 theorem/proof block: attack hemGeneratorTraceLawIntegral, with the expected route through hemGeneratorTraceStateIntegral plus hhatRhoS/hhatX/htraceFieldMeas and SALD.generalMovingTargetDiscreteEmGeneratorTraceLawIntegralOfStateIntegral.
- Task blueprint: `research-wiki/blueprints/ASTIS-SALD-001.md`.
- Borrowed LeanMarathon controls: blueprint system-of-record, target review, dynamic leaves, illness-area refiner, deterministic gate.
- Preserved ASTIS controls: EoH candidate populations for exploratoryProof, LBG-style trial memory, ARIS/QBE upper-middle-lower-reviewer loops, auto-research-in-sleep long run, SDE/Sampling source anchors.

## Self-Reflection Guard

- Start the handoff with one packet classification from the allowed list.
- Name the exact supplied hypothesis discharged or the exact missing theorem boundary narrowed.
- State whether the packet is a dynamic-leaf worker packet or an illness-area refiner packet.
- State which local SLT/Mathlib files were consulted or why no consultation was needed.
- Reject broad source-index, route-audit, wrapper, or project-article work unless it directly closes the active blocker.
- Keep `python3 tools/astis.py check` as the mandatory gate.

## Role Instructions

Attempt one narrow proof-producing Lean task for the assigned active backend before creating more ledger-only obligations. Do not change the theorem target. Begin by naming the packet classification and the exact supplied hypothesis or missing theorem boundary. If this is a worker-style packet, stay inside the assigned local target/refinement region before asking for upstream changes; if it is a refiner-style packet, edit only the connected illness area named by middle. Do not work on unrelated display algebra, route audits, or general API cleanup unless the upper/middle packet explicitly assigns it. After cycle 84, a new supplied-hypothesis wrapper is acceptable only if it removes an older supplied hypothesis, exposes a strictly smaller missing theorem boundary, or produces a compiled local theorem using Mathlib/local SLT-style ingredients. Do not add fake proof closures; if the analysis fact is not formalized, add a precise source-cited interface or refine a ProofObligation and keep the build green. In Phase 1 faithfulPaper mode, do not introduce broad library reorganizations or educational APIs unless upper/middle explicitly assign them. For SALD cycle 130 and later, treat the cycle-129 illness-area boundary as the live target unless the reviewer records a newer one: `hdiffusionSource` has been narrowed to the EM/Brownian diffusion generator weak action plus weak Laplacian integration-by-parts action. Do not reassign already-discharged leaves `hsampleInt`, `hsampleDerivMeas`, `hsampleDerivBound`, `hboundInt`, `hpathDeriv`, `hderivValue`, `hdriftBarBAction`, raw `hpairMeas`, or `hcanonicalBarBMeas`. For SALD cycle 151 and later, the reviewer-accepted cycle-150 boundary overrides older broad guards. The active EM conditional-law / weak-FP backend remains `sald.general_moving_target_discrete.em_interpolation_fp` over `appendix.tex:1358-1387`, with source anchors `appendix.tex:984-995`, `appendix.tex:1368-1387`, and `appendix.tex:1379-1387`. Prioritize one direct definition/equality leaf at a time: `htraceFieldEqLaplacian`, `hemGeneratorLaplacianEventFieldEqTraceField`, `hemGeneratorLaplacianStateIntegral`, or `hsourceLaplacianFieldMeas`. Upper should choose the smallest leaf that reduces this boundary; middle should coordinate the proof route and split lower-agent roles; lower_1 should produce the natural-language/math route and lower_2 should implement exactly one compiled Lean theorem or a strictly smaller source-cited obligation. Reject new total-event/source-functional consumer wrappers unless they discharge one of these direct leaves. Reviewer must check that the remaining boundary is strictly smaller, not merely renamed, and that `python3 tools/astis.py check` passes.

Parallel lower specialization: you are the Lean proof implementer. First read the shared dialogue for the lower_1 natural-language proof scout handoff, then implement exactly one compiled Lean theorem or a strictly smaller source-cited boundary from that route. If lower_1's route is invalid, record the precise failure and implement the next smallest correct boundary instead. Keep the build green and do not broaden the target.
